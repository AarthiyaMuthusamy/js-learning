lesson 2: Numbers and Math

like normally calculating maths 

* /  are done first
+ - are done second

* / have the same priority 
2 *  3 / 5 calculate from left to right

+ - have the same priority 
2 + 3 - 5  calculate from left to right

control the calculation using brackets 
have the higher priority then * /
(1+1)*3 = 2*3 = 6

oder of operations:

1) (....)
2) * /
3) + -


how do avoid float values ? 

1) calculated in cents instead of dollars 
2) convert back to dollars

Math.round((2095 +799) * 0.1 ) / 100 => this is a right way to calculate
